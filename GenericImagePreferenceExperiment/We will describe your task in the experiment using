[Do a few demo trials.]

On each trial, you will be presented with two side-by-side images which depict the same scene.  Your task is to **select which of the two images looks better to you**. Note that we are not necessarily interested in the brightest image, in which all scene regions are clearly visible, but in the image that is more appealing to you.

You will enter your choice by pressing one of the **two upper trigger buttons** in a gamepad. If you prefer the left image, press the left button, if you prefer the right image, press the right button. **Even if both images look equally good (or bad), you will need to enter a preference**. After your choice is made, a new trial will begin with a new set of images.

**Images in different trials may vary in the shape, the material, or both shape and material of the depicted objects**.  Trials are organized in blocks, with each block containing **168** trials. There will be **8** of these blocks today.

Try **not to take breaks within a block of trials**. When a block of trials is completed, you will see a **cartoon** image.  At this time you can take a **little time to rest**. When you are **done resting, press the left or right upper trigger button** to continue with the next block of trials.

When all **blocks are finished, you will see a fireworks image** and the computer will produce an **audible notification** that the session is over.

When you are done, please by my office (**Rm 334C**), to **schedule the next session**. 

Do you have any questions?
