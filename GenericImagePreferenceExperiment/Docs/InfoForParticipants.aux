The tone mapping functions (red lines) map scene luminance (x-axis) onto display luminance (y-axis). The less compressive function (left) maintains resolution of the highlights of the blobbie object, but results in a darker image overall. The more compressive function (right) results in a brighter image, but resolution of the highlights is lost, and the object material appears more 'plasticky'.}}{1}}
